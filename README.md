# bot.sh
Actually, this repository is a small kick start for my bash journey.
Basically I am a beginner in bash scripting(shell script) or just learning bash script and this is my first repository on Github platform. 

It's a bot which gives a basic input/output interaction.

So,I think some of you guys may gain a little bit knowledge from my repository.
Thank you.
